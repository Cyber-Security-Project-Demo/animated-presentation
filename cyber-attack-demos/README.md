# Cyber Attack Demos - Educational Tool

An interactive educational application that demonstrates 6 common cyber attack types through animated presentations. Designed to help non-technical users understand cybersecurity vulnerabilities in an engaging and easy-to-understand way.

## 🎯 Attack Types Covered

### 1. SQL Injection
- Shows how malicious code can trick databases into revealing secrets
- Demonstrates the difference between normal login and injection attacks
- Includes protection mechanisms

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Illustrates how bad scripts can steal information from websites
- Shows the progression from normal search to malicious script execution
- Demonstrates how protection shields work

### 3. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Explains how changing numbers in URLs can access other people's data
- Shows the vulnerability of trusting user input without proper authorization
- Demonstrates proper access control

### 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Shows how fake buttons can make actions without user permission
- Demonstrates automatic cookie transmission and forged requests
- Explains CSRF token protection

### 5. Command Injection
- Shows how search boxes can be tricked into deleting entire databases
- Demonstrates the catastrophic impact of unvalidated input
- Shows input validation and sanitization protection

### 6. API Exploitation
- Demonstrates how attackers convert secure POST requests to dangerous GET requests
- Shows the vulnerability of improper API request method validation
- Illustrates the importance of proper API security measures
